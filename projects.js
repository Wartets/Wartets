		longDescrition: `Origami is an advanced, interactive web-based simulator dedicated to exploring the mathematical principles of paper folding. The application provides a comprehensive toolset based on the seven Huzita-Hatori axioms, allowing users to construct complex crease patterns with geometric precision. Users create folds by selecting points and edges on virtual paper, with real-time visual feedback that includes construction lines and a preview of the resulting crease. The simulation engine accurately handles face splitting, vertex reflection, and the complex layering of paper that results from each fold. It also includes an undo/redo history, state persistence, an X-ray mode to see hidden layers, and the ability to import standard Crease Pattern (.cp) files. This project is both an educational tool for learning geometric constructions and a creative sandbox for origami enthusiasts and mathematicians.`,
